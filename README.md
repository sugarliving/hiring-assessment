# Sugar Hiring Assignment

Sugar is preparing to launch at City View Apartments. City View uses the Acme Locks keyless entry system to allow residents to unlock doors within the building. They have provided us with the following information:

- A list of resident information (including which doors each user has access to): `residents.csv`
- A list of doors and their corresponding Acme Locks device IDs: `doors.csv`
- Credentials to access the Acme Locks API: `api.txt`

**Your task is to build an application that allows all City View residents to securely lock and unlock the doors that they have access to.**

The description of this task is purposefully ambiguous - we want to see how well you can scope, design, and build an end-to-end application that solves a real problem for users.

Feel free to use whatever languages / frameworks / tools you are most comfortable with to build this application. You can build any kind of application (web, mobile, API, something else entirely), as long as it solves the core problem of allowing residents to securely lock and unlock the doors that they have access to.

Please limit the time you spend working on this project to a **maximum of 3-5 hours**.

The scope of this problem may be larger than the timeframe allotted to solving it - that's ok. If that is the case, please describe in detail any other components of your application that you would build to solve the core problem given more development time.

Please submit your completed application via email as a Github repo containing all source code, assets, and documentation that you wish to include in your submission.

To make this challenge fair to everyone, plase don't fork this repo to develop your application (unless you use a private repository) or share your application with others. Please don't copy any one else's solutions if you find them online.
